Access large language models from the command-line

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install llm

You need an OpenAI API key, which should either be set in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, or saved in a plain text file called `~/.openai-api-key.txt` in your home directory.

## Usage

The default command for this is `llm chatgpt` - you can use `llm` instead if you prefer.

To run a prompt:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes'

To stream the results a token at a time:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -s

To switch from ChatGPT 3.5 (the default) to GPT-4 if you have access:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -4

Pass `--model <model name>` to use a different model.

### Using with a shell

To generate a description of changes made to a Git repository since the last commit:

    llm "Describe these changes: $(git diff)"

This pattern of using `$(command)` inside a double quoted string is a useful way to quickly assemble prompts.

## System prompts

You can use `--system '...'` to set a system prompt.

    llm 'SQL to calculate total sales by month' -s \
      --system 'You are an exaggerated sentient cheesecake that knows SQL and talks about cheesecake a lot'

The `--code` option will set a system prompt for you that attempts to output just code without explanation, and will strip off any leading or trailing markdown code block syntax. You can use this to generate code and write it straight to a file:

    llm 'Python CLI tool: reverse string passed to stdin' --code > fetch.py

Be _very careful_ executing code generated by a LLM - always read it first!

## Logging to SQLite

If a SQLite database file exists in `~/.llm/log.db` then the tool will log all prompts and responses to it.

You can create that file by running the `init-db` command:

    llm init-db

Now any prompts you run will be logged to that database.

To avoid logging a prompt, pass `--no-log` or `-n` to the command:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -n

### Viewing the logs

You can view the logs using the `llm logs` command:

    llm logs

This will output the three most recent logged items as a JSON array of objects.

Add `-n 10` to see the ten most recent items:

    llm logs -n 10

Or `-n 0` to see everything that has ever been logged:

    llm logs -n 0

You can also use [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) to browse your logs like this:

    datasette ~/.llm/log.db

## Help

For help, run:

    llm --help

You can also use:

    python -m llm --help

## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd llm
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest
