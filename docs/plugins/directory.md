- **[llm-fragments-reader](https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-reader)** runs a URL theough the Jina Reader API: `llm -f 'reader:https://simonwillison.net/tags/jina/' summary`.

## Embedding models

{ref}`Embedding models <embeddings>` are models that can be used to generate and store embedding vectors for text.

- **[llm-sentence-transformers](https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers)** adds support for embeddings using the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which provides access to [a wide range](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) of embedding models.
- **[llm-clip](https://github.com/simonw/llm-clip)** provides the [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) model, which can be used to embed images and text in the same vector space, enabling text search against images. See [Build an image search engine with llm-clip](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/12/llm-clip-and-chat/) for more on this plugin.
- **[llm-embed-jina](https://github.com/simonw/llm-embed-jina)** provides Jina AI's [8K text embedding models](https://jina.ai/news/jina-ai-launches-worlds-first-open-source-8k-text-embedding-rivaling-openai/).
- **[llm-embed-onnx](https://github.com/simonw/llm-embed-onnx)** provides seven embedding models that can be executed using the ONNX model framework.

## Extra commands

- **[llm-cmd](https://github.com/simonw/llm-cmd)** accepts a prompt for a shell command, runs that prompt and populates the result in your shell so you can review it, edit it and then hit `<enter>` to execute or `ctrl+c` to cancel.
- **[llm-cmd-comp](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/llm-cmd-comp)** provides a key binding for your shell that will launch a chat to build the command. When ready, hit `<enter>` and it will go right back into your shell command line, so you can run it.
- **[llm-python](https://github.com/simonw/llm-python)** adds a `llm python` command for running a Python interpreter in the same virtual environment as LLM. This is useful for debugging, and also provides a convenient way to interact with the LLM {ref}`python-api` if you installed LLM using Homebrew or `pipx`.
- **[llm-cluster](https://github.com/simonw/llm-cluster)** adds a `llm cluster` command for calculating clusters for a collection of embeddings. Calculated clusters can then be passed to a Large Language Model to generate a summary description.
- **[llm-jq](https://github.com/simonw/llm-jq)** lets you pipe in JSON data and a prompt describing a `jq` program, then executes the generated program against the JSON.

## Just for fun

- **[llm-markov](https://github.com/simonw/llm-markov)** adds a simple model that generates output using a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). This example is used in the tutorial [Writing a plugin to support a new model](https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html).
